## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
Create teams of specialized AI agents that work together on complex tasks. Each agent has distinct capabilities and can delegate work to others based on expertise requirements.

### Dynamic Delegation System  
Agents automatically route tasks to the most appropriate specialists, creating efficient workflows that adapt to your specific needs without manual coordination.

### Knowledge Bases
Upload documents, create searchable knowledge repositories, and give agents access to your information. All processing happens locally with complete privacy.

### Actor Model Architecture
Built on proven concurrency patterns for reliable multi-agent coordination, ensuring stable operation even with complex delegation chains.

### System Modification
Agents can propose and implement system improvements with your approval, expanding capabilities and creating custom tools as needed.

### Project Templates
Use structured workflows that organize complex work across multiple sessions, with agent teams that remember context and continue where you left off.

## Why Wippy Portable?

**Complete Privacy**: All your data remains on your local machine. No cloud storage or external data processing beyond AI model access.

**Agent Specialization**: Instead of one generalist AI, coordinate teams of specialist agents each optimized for specific tasks.

**Persistent Context**: Projects and knowledge bases maintain state across sessions, building institutional memory over time.

**Self-Improving**: The system can evolve and adapt to your workflows through controlled self-modification capabilities.

**Integration Ready**: Connect to external services and APIs while maintaining local control and data sovereignty.
